## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a Jellyfin server to use this app?**
A: Yes! JellyWear is a companion app that connects to your existing Jellyfin server. It doesn't host or store any media itself.

**Q: Can I watch videos on my watch?**
A: JellyWear is designed for remote control and browsing. While you can start playback, the video will play on your connected Jellyfin client (TV, phone, etc.), not on the watch itself.

**Q: Which Jellyfin clients can I control?**
A: You can control any active Jellyfin session on your server — including Jellyfin Media Player, web browser, Android TV, and more.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: No, JellyWear requires a network connection to communicate with your Jellyfin server.

**Q: Is this an official Jellyfin app?**
A: No, JellyWear is an independent project and is not affiliated with the Jellyfin team.
